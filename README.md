# School_District_Analysis

## Software: Python 3.7 and Jupyter notebook

## Summary
This analysis was done using the data from the PyCity school district. The data was about Math scores, Reading scores and the budget for both public and charter schools in the district. Also, the Math and Reading scores were provided for each grade. 

According to the analysis done here, it can be observed that public schools’ average budget is higher than charter schools’ budget. However, the average budget is computed by giving equal weights to each school. The number of students in those schools vary from 171 to 2038. Therefore, I think it would be a good idea to consider budget per student to see any hidden information.

Also, the average math score in charter schools is above the combined average and average math scores of public schools is below the combined average. However, the average reading scores are very close to each other. An interesting fact is that the 12th grade average math score in public schools is higher than the that of charter schools.
